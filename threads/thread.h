/* A kernel thread or user process.

   Each thread structure is stored in its own 4 kB page.  The
   thread structure itself sits at the very bottom of the page
   (at offset 0).  The rest of the page is reserved for the
   thread's kernel stack, which grows downward from the top of
   the page (at offset 4 kB).  Here's an illustration:

        4 kB +---------------------------------+
             |          kernel stack           |
             |                |                |
             |                |                |
             |                V                |
             |         grows downward          |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             |                                 |
             +---------------------------------+
             |              magic              |
             |                :                |

             |              status             |
        0 kB +---------------------------------+

   The upshot of this is twofold:

      1. First, `struct thread' must not be allowed to grow too
         big.  If it does, then there will not be enough room for
         the kernel stack.  Our base `struct thread' is only a
         few bytes in size.  It probably should stay well under 1
         kB.

      2. Second, kernel stacks must not be allowed to grow too
         large.  If a stack overflows, it will corrupt the thread
         state.  Thus, kernel functions should not allocate large
         structures or arrays as non-static local variables.  Use
         dynamic allocation with malloc() or palloc_get_page()
         instead.

   The first symptom of either of these problems will probably be
   an assertion failure in thread_current(), which checks that
   the `magic' member of the running thread's `struct thread' is
   set to THREAD_MAGIC.  Stack overflow will normally change this
   value, triggering the assertion. */
/* The `elem' member has a dual purpose.  It can be an element in
   the run queue (thread.c), or it can be an element in a
   semaphore wait list (synch.c).  It can be used these two ways
   only because they are mutually exclusive: only a thread in the
   ready state is on the run queue, whereas only a thread in the
   blocked state is on a semaphore wait list. */
